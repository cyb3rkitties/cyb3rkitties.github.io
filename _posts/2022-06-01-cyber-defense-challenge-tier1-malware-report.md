For the first tier of the **Cyber Defense Challenge** powered by [Women in Cybersecurity](https://www.wicys.org/) and [Target](https://www.target.com/), I was given a spreadsheet containing malicious code and used tools such as Olevba, Speakeasy, Ghidra, and custom Python scripts to:

- Extract the malicious macro.
- De-obfuscate the code and extract shellcode.
- Emulate shellcode.
- Disassemble shellcode and extract IOCs and file names.

As a result of the investigation, I produced this complete malware analysis report.

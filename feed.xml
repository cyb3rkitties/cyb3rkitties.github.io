It’s written in Rust and it appears to be an evolution of Exe_who. The tool and its source code were found in the wild while performing threat hunting and analysis on open directories via the Censys database, along with a parser script written in Python that... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Malware Analysis &amp; Investigation Framework</title><link href="https://cyberkitties.github.io/posts/malware-analysis-investigation-framework/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Malware Analysis &amp; Investigation Framework" /><published>2023-10-03T14:31:00+00:00</published> <updated>2023-10-04T01:43:04+00:00</updated> <id>https://cyberkitties.github.io/posts/malware-analysis-investigation-framework/</id> <content src="https://cyberkitties.github.io/posts/malware-analysis-investigation-framework/" /> <author> <name>al3x</name> </author> <category term="projects" /> <summary> If you started your malware analysis journey fairly recently, you have probably wondered a few times: where do I start from? What do I prioritize? That’s exactly what happened to me: at times, the amount of information collected can be overwhelming and this can make it tricky to focus on a single aspect of the findings. And that’s why I came up with the idea of this Malware Analysis &amp;amp; Inve... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Horabot - Malicious Infrastructure Investigation</title><link href="https://cyberkitties.github.io/posts/horabot-malicious-infrastructure-investigation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Horabot - Malicious Infrastructure Investigation" /><published>2023-07-01T12:25:00+00:00</published> <updated>2023-11-19T16:52:45+00:00</updated> <id>https://cyberkitties.github.io/posts/horabot-malicious-infrastructure-investigation/</id> <content src="https://cyberkitties.github.io/posts/horabot-malicious-infrastructure-investigation/" /> <author> <name>al3x</name> </author> <category term="research" /> <summary> After brainstorming for quite a while and getting incredibly excited for obtaining research access to Censys.io Search, I saw a very interesting report from the great folks at Cisco Talos on a new phishing campaign they track as Horabot and decided it was time to dig into an investigation and get lost in the many rabbit holes of threat hunting. My starting points were the Indicators of Comprom... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering Study Plan for Beginners</title><link href="https://cyberkitties.github.io/posts/malware-analysis-reverse-engineering-beginner-study-plan/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering Study Plan for Beginners" /><published>2023-01-03T09:39:00+00:00</published> <updated>2023-04-16T19:11:46+00:00</updated> <id>https://cyberkitties.github.io/posts/malware-analysis-reverse-engineering-beginner-study-plan/</id> <content src="https://cyberkitties.github.io/posts/malware-analysis-reverse-engineering-beginner-study-plan/" /> <author> <name>al3x</name> </author> <category term="training" /> <summary> As more people have been asking me for beginner-level malware analysis and reverse engineering training material, I decided to put together this short study plan with free and affordable resources to get you started on analyzing (mostly) Windows executables, with some references here and there to Linux as well. A word of caution before digging in: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON UDEMY.

As a beginner in information security, and as someone with a full-time job and various other commitments, preparing three GIAC certification in roughly six months was certainly a challenge. But, if you’re con... </summary> </entry> </feed>

I'm a **malware analyst and threat researcher** with over ten years of total work experience, the last two of which focused on reverse engineering and threat hunting, and an extensive background in translating technical concepts into written reports and presentations for a variety of audiences.

I also provide **consulting services to nonprofits and small businesses** by advising them on the current threat landscape, delivering information sessions and security awareness training, and supporting risk assessments through the use of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).

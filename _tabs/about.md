I'm a **cyber threat intelligence and malware analysis professional** in the making with a passion for in-depth research and analysis, an obsession for discovering patterns, and over 10 years of experience in translating technical concepts into compelling written and multimedia content. I'm enrolled in the SANS Women's Immersion Academy 2022.

I pride myself on being a **fully self-taught programmer and cybersecurity practitioner.** My current interests include **threat intelligence analysis, malware analysis, reverse engineering, and OSINT.**

I'm active on CTF platforms (top 3,500 on TryHackMe). I speak fluent Python, Bash, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I'm learning Assembly and practicing crackme challenges.

I recently launched a newsletter called wannaCYbeR (security) dedicated to people starting their cybersecurity journey. I use it as my creative outlet to speak about threat intelligence, APT groups, cybersecurity in the geopolitical context, useful resources, and events.
